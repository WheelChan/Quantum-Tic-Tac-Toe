# Quantum-Tic-Tac-Toe
Using Python, the goal is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game based off quantum entanglement. This project is inspired by the description of the game given by the Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL_kZAEuWSM&amp;ab_channel=nanohubtechtalks


# HOW TO USE CODE
1. Need to install tkinter and qiskit packages.
2. Code provided in code will create an app. The text entry bar will measure if the letter 'm' is present in the box and will place qubits in squares if not.


# CURRENT ISSUES
1. App still needs to be refined.
2. Qubit measurement does not produce desired results, is most likely due to the quantum gates currently employed in code.
